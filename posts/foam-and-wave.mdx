Do you know the tale<br />
of the Achaean<br />
who died for Love?<br />
Always Fleeing,<br />
Searching for More,<br />
Even in Death,<br />
Pure in her Pride,<br />
On the Last Day,<br />
she lowered herself.<br />
Forever remained,<br />
Foam and Wave.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
So are you.<br />
High on the branch,<br />
In vain they stretch their arms.<br />
They cannot reach you.
